# Keylogger Program

## Overview
This project implements a basic keylogger program in Python. The keylogger records and logs keystrokes and saves them to a file. **Important: This tool should only be used with the explicit permission of the user whose activity is being monitored. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and is considered a violation of privacy.**

## Concepts and Theory

### Keylogging
Keylogging is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard. It is often used to monitor user activity for various reasons, such as debugging, monitoring employees, or recovering lost input data. However, it is crucial to use keyloggers ethically and legally.

### Python `pynput` Library
The `pynput` library allows for monitoring and controlling input devices. It can capture keyboard events, which makes it suitable for implementing a keylogger.
